### 4. `repositories`

- **Description**: This directory contains database repositories for users and products.
- **Components**:
  - `UserRepository`: Responsible for interacting with the database to perform user-related operations.
  - `ProductRepository`: Responsible for interacting with the database to perform product-related operations.

### 5. `services`

- **Description**: This directory contains business logic services for authentication and products.
- **Components**:
  - `AuthService`: Provides a set of methods for handling authentication-related business logic.
  - `ProductService`: Provides a set of methods for handling product-related business logic.

### 6. `controllers`

- **Description**: This directory contains controllers for handling incoming requests and sending responses.
- **Components**:
  - `AuthController`: Handles incoming requests and sends responses for authentication-related endpoints.
  - `UserController`: Handles incoming requests and sends responses for user-related endpoints.
  - `ProductController`: Handles incoming requests and sends responses for product-related endpoints.

### 7. `database`

- **Description**: This directory contains database configuration and models.
- **Components**:
  - `database.js`: Contains database connection settings and models.

## **Files**

- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application, responsible for setting up the Express.js server and routing.
- `app.js`: Contains the Express.js application instance and middleware configurations.

## **Dependencies**

- `express`: The web framework used to build the application.
- `mongoose`: The database management system used to interact with the MongoDB database.
- `bcryptjs`: The library used for password hashing and verification.
- `jsonwebtoken`: The library used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.

## **Estimated Time of Tasks**

- **Setting up the project structure and dependencies**: 2 hours
